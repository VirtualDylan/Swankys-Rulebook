To write good technical specifications, it is crucial to understand their purpose, the information they must capture, and the principles of well-formed requirements. Technical specifications emerge from the Architectural Design Process and are finalized during the Design Solution Definition Process, detailing *how* the system will be built to satisfy the defined requirements.

Here's a breakdown of how to write good technical specifications:

### 1. Purpose and Context of Technical Specifications
Technical specifications define the system solution, providing the necessary guidance, constraints, and requirements for design engineers to proceed with development. They synthesize a system solution that meets requirements. This involves translating logical decomposition models and derived requirements into a detailed design solution.

### 2. Key Information to Capture in Technical Specifications
When writing technical specifications, you should document the following:

*   **Architecture Design Baseline**: This is the result of the Architectural Design Process and should be placed under configuration management.
*   **System Element Detailed Descriptions**: Provide detailed descriptions of the individual components or subsystems that constitute the overall system.
*   **Requirements Assigned to System Elements**: Clearly indicate how the system's requirements are allocated to specific elements.
*   **Interface Requirements**: Identify and document the interfaces between system elements and with external and enabling systems. These include structural, thermal, electrical, signal, and human-system interfaces. Interface control documents (e.g., IRD, ICD, IDD, ICP) are key outputs for capturing this information.
*   **System Integration Strategy**: Outline how the various elements will be brought together.
*   **Verification Strategy and Plans**: Define how the design and eventual system will be verified. This plan should include verification methods (analysis, inspection, demonstration, test), required facilities/labs, and the phase in which verification will occur.
*   **End-Product Specifications**: These are the detailed "build-to" and "code-to" requirements, covering materials, dimensions, and quality of work for manufacturing.
*   **End-Product Interface Specifications**: Detailed "build-to" and "code-to" requirements for the behavior and characteristics of all logical and physical interfaces of the end product with external elements, including human-system interfaces.
*   **Initial Subsystem Specifications**: Provide detailed information for subsystems, if necessary.
*   **Enabling Product Requirements**: Detail the requirements for all supporting products, infrastructures, personnel, logistics, and services necessary to facilitate the operational end product throughout its life cycle.
*   **Product Validation Plan**: Detail all activities for validating the end product against stakeholder expectations.
*   **Logistics and Operate-to Procedures**: Describe handling, transportation, maintenance, long-term storage, and operational considerations specific to the design solution.

### 3. Guidelines for Writing Good Technical Specifications

Drawing on principles for good requirements and general documentation practices, consider the following:

*   **Use of Correct Terms**:
    *   Use "**Shall**" for requirements (obligatory statements).
    *   Use "**Will**" for facts or declarations of purpose.
    *   Use "**Should**" for goals.
*   **Clarity and Conciseness**:
    *   Be **clear and unambiguous**, avoiding indefinite pronouns (this, these) or ambiguous terms (e.g., "as appropriate," "etc.").
    *   Be **concise and simple**.
    *   Express **only one thought per statement**, with one subject and one predicate.
*   **Completeness**:
    *   State requirements as **completely as possible**.
    *   Minimize "To Be Determined" (TBD) values; use "To Be Resolved" (TBR) with rationale, responsibility, and due date instead.
    *   Explicitly state all assumptions.
*   **Consistency**:
    *   Ensure **consistency** with other requirements and related systems.
    *   Use **consistent terminology** with users, sponsors, and the project glossary.
*   **Traceability**:
    *   Each technical specification should be **necessary** to meet a parent requirement or mission objective.
    *   Maintain **bidirectional traceability** to higher-level requirements, mission/system scope, or Concept of Operations.
    *   Each requirement should be **uniquely referenced/numbered**.
    *   Capturing the **source and rationale** for each requirement is advisable.
*   **Correctness and Feasibility**:
    *   Requirements must be **technically feasible** and correct.
    *   Assumptions supporting requirements should be **stated and confirmed** before baselining.
*   **Quantifiable Values and Tolerances**:
    *   Where applicable, include **tolerances** for quantitative/performance values (e.g., "less than," "greater than or equal to," "plus or minus").
    *   Ensure performance requirements are realistic and tolerances are defensible and cost-effective.
*   **Avoid Implementation Specifics**:
    *   State *what* is needed, not *how* to provide it. Avoid mixing design solutions with requirements.
*   **Address "ilities" (Non-functional Requirements)**:
    *   Incorporate requirements for aspects like affordability, maintainability, producibility, reliability, safety, security, and supportability. For instance, human engineering design requirements define aspects of hardware and software necessary for operators to interact with the system effectively.
*   **Verification and Validation Criteria**:
    *   Define **verification criteria concurrently** with analysis to ensure requirements are verifiable. The system must be testable, demonstrable, inspectable, or analyzable to show it satisfies requirements.
    *   Consider validation criteria, which confirm that the realized system complies with stakeholder requirements, chosen based on perceived risks, safety, and criticality.
*   **Modeling and Simulation**:
    *   Modeling techniques like SysML are useful for deriving a logical architecture and capturing requirements hierarchies. Analysis can utilize modeling and simulation to predict suitability of a design. Prototypes (rapid or traditional) can also significantly enhance the likelihood of meeting user needs and reduce risk.
*   **Iterative Refinement**:
    *   The design process is **recursive and iterative**, with feedback from stakeholders and reviewers. Changes are more expensive the later they occur in the development process.
*   **Configuration Control**:
    *   Once finalized and baselined, technical specifications (including the architectural design and system element descriptions) must be placed under **configuration management** to ensure integrity and traceability of product configurations and control changes throughout the life cycle. This typically includes functional, allocated, and product baselines.

### 4. Tailoring the Documentation
The level of formality and detail in technical specifications should be **tailored to the specific project's size, complexity, and risk**. For example, smaller projects may require less formal documentation than larger, more complex ones. This tailoring ensures a balance between thoroughness and avoiding "process paralysis".
